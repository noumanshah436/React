Integrate Tailwind CSS and Flowbite React

We aim to enhance the styling capabilities of our application by integrating Tailwind CSS and Flowbite. This integration will provide us with a robust set of utility classes and streamlined workflow for designing and developing user interfaces.

Tasks:

Install Tailwind CSS: Set up Tailwind CSS in the project environment to leverage its utility-first approach for styling components.
Configure Tailwind: Configure Tailwind CSS to customize design such as colors, spacing, and typography to align with our figma design system.
Integrate Flowbite: Integrate Flowbite into the development workflow to use its interactive UI components built with the utility classes from Tailwind CSS



1)
$ npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
 
2) 
$ npx tailwindcss init -p

Created Tailwind CSS config file: tailwind.config.js
Created PostCSS config file: postcss.config.js
 
 
3)  
tailwind.config.js file:
module.exports = {
  content: [
    './src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}


4) 
Set up the Tailwind directives inside the ./src/index.css file:

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

also add this css file in index.js

import './index.css'

$ npm install flowbite flowbite-react

6) 

Require Flowbite as a plugin inside your tailwind.config.js file:
module.exports = {

    plugins: [

    ]

}
