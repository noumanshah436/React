reduxForm is a function provided by the redux-form library for connecting your form component to the Redux store.

Config parameter object passed with reduxForm:

This specifies the name of the form. It is an identifier for the form data in the Redux store.

touchOnChange: true:
This option ensures that the form fields are marked as "touched" when they are changed.

enableReinitialize: false:
This option prevents the form from automatically reinitializing when the form name changes.
