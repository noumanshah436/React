Follow tutorials:

1) create actions
2) create reducers
3) create store and provide it to the app in app.js
4) create react component and we can access redux store in our component in two ways
    i) using connect function that maps our component to the redux store (see cakeContainer.js)
    ii) using useSelector, useDispatch hooks (see HookCakeContainer.js)


*****************************

How you can add another reducer for newFeature in this app:

1) create newFeature folder in `src/redux` and add files in it for action-types, actions-creators and the reducer.
2) Export you action creator from `src/redux/index.js` and import the reducer in root reducer.
3) create new component in `src/components` and access the state as well as dispatch the new action.
