onAuthStateChanged:

The onAuthStateChanged() method gets triggered when a user authentication state changes 
such as creating a new user account, logging in to a user account, or logging out.

For example, when the app loads for the first time the onAuthStateChange() method will return null because at that 
time no user account is created.

As soon as a new user account is created, the onAuthStateChanged() method will return the newly logged-in userâ€™s data.
